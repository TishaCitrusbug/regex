/^ and $/:

^: Asserts the position at the start of the string.
$: Asserts the position at the end of the string.
Together, they ensure the entire string is checked against the pattern, not just a part of it.
(?=.*[0-9]):

(?= ... ): This is a positive lookahead assertion. It asserts that what is inside the parentheses must be present in the string, but it doesn't consume characters in the string.
.*: Matches any character (except for line terminators) any number of times, including zero times.
[0-9]: Matches any digit from 0 to 9.
Combined, (?=.*[0-9]) ensures that the string contains at least one digit.
(?=.*[a-z]):

[a-z]: Matches any lowercase letter.
Combined, (?=.*[a-z]) ensures that the string contains at least one lowercase letter.
(?=.*[A-Z]):

[A-Z]: Matches any uppercase letter.
Combined, (?=.*[A-Z]) ensures that the string contains at least one uppercase letter.
(?=.*_):

_: Matches the underscore character.
Combined, (?=.*_) ensures that the string contains at least one underscore.
(?!.* ):

(?! ... ): This is a negative lookahead assertion. It asserts that what is inside the parentheses must not be present in the string.
.*: Matches any character (except for line terminators) any number of times, including zero times.
(space): Matches a space character.
Combined, (?!.* ) ensures that the string does not contain any spaces.
.{8,16}:

.: Matches any character (except for line terminators).
{8,16}: Specifies that the preceding element must occur at least 8 times and at most 16 times.
Combined, .{8,16} ensures that the string is between 8 and 16 characters long.
